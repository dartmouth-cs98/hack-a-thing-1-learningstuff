## Overview
We wanted to try learning React so we started with a very basic tutorial to build a tic-tac-toe game since we both had no previous knowledge of what React is / how it works. We found the tutorial on [Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/).

After completing the tic-tac-toe tutorial, we realized it would helpful to learn how to build an app with React, so with the help of a different tutorial, we built a calculator for mobile app with React Native. After building the basic functionality, we also added a few extra features in order to experiment with React Native more, such as adding a clear button, a Fibonacci number detector, and a number-press frequency detector (calculator numbers get bigger when pressed more frequently). We thought that the frequency detector was really interesting because it visualizes how frequently each digit appears in numbers we use every day.

## Who did what
We mostly met and worked together for both tutorials so we could both have a full understanding of React.js and React-Native. We took turns being the person writing code and pushing to Github. For the calculator, Emily tried running the iOS emulator and Hanting tried running the Android emulator, and ultimatley we were able to get the Android emulator running first, so we both continued working with the Android emulator for the rest of the project.

## What we learned
We learned a basic understanding of how to use React.js, React Native and also Android Studio / Android emulator. This was our first time attempting to use React and thought this project was very helpful in establishing a basic understanding of designing and programming apps with React.

## What didnâ€™t work
We had a few issues with setting up Github and downloading Android / iOS emulators for the calculator tutorial. The tutorial is from 2016 and some of the entry point files are now changed so we had to figure out what was missing in order for our emulators to run, which took us a very long time. We got the Android emulator running first so ultimatley went with Android for the app, but in the future and if we had more time we would be interested in using React-Native for iOS as well.
